# DataAnalysis - (UFRN - IMD0033\_2018.1 - Probabilidade)

##### This project is part of a **BTI** course called **Probabilidade** where we study Data Science.

##### The original data used on our database is freely available on the school's website: [dados.ufrn.br](dados.ufrn.br).

##### In particular, we collected data from [dados.ufrn.br/dataset/obras](http://dados.ufrn.br/dataset/obras) to practice what we have being studying on the discipline about **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Exploratory Data Visualization**.

## UFRN's Constructions and Remodelations from the Resource Fonts' of Investments

### Introduction
We are analysing *how much*, *when*, and *by whom* the money destined for constructions and renovations is being spent on UFRN, possibiliting a better understanding of this data using graphs as visual aid, we intend to analize which ones have finished their projects, how long it takes to finish them, which companies are responsible for them, how much each project costs, who is the main source of investments, etc.


### Programming Language and Libraries
For this project we are using *Python 3* and for educational purposes we are using *Notebook Jupyter*.
We used the following libraries to aid us on creating the material displayed on the notebook:

- **pandas** -- for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib** -- for embedding plots into applications as visual aid
